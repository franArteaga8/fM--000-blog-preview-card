## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned to use clamp to achieve responsiveness without media queries.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  width: clamp(327px, 15vw + 15rem, 384px);
 
  aspect-ratio: 1/1;
  width: 32px;
}
```

### Continued development

I still wanna improve my handling of responsive sizes.
